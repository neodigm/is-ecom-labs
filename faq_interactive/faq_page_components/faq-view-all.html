Most states require purchasers to file a use tax return to report any purchase that was not taxed and pay tax on the purchase. Details of how to report and pay tax to your state may be found at your state taxing authority's website. In addition, the states of Colorado, Kentucky, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Vermont require us to provide the following additional information:

These forms and corresponding instructions may be found on the Kentucky Department of Revenue's Internet Web site at www.revenue.ky.gov/individual/usetax.

If you submit the claim prior to placing your order, one of our associates will adjust the price for you at the time of ordering. For previously placed orders paid by credit card, the refund will be issued to your credit card within 72 hours of receiving the competitor ad for verification. If you paid by check and your refund amount is over $2, a refund check will be issued and mailed to you within 10 days of receiving the competitor ad for verification.

  <h3 style="boder-bottom: 1px solid #ccc; padding-bottom:.5rem margin-bottom:.5rem;">Terms and Conditions</h3>
  <ol>
	   <li>A signed Master Agreement must be received prior to sales becoming eligible for fundraising rebate. The person signing the agreement must be an authorized member of the school community he/she is representing and agrees to and understands the Terms and Conditions stated below.</li>
	   <li>All purchases eligible for fundraising rebate must be made by school families using the customized link assigned by LTD Commodities to the school. LTD does not guarantee rebate for sales where the customer has not clicked through the direct link provided to the school's fundraising coordinator.</li>
	   <li>All rebates are based on product sales only (shipping costs are not eligible in the rebate calculation).</li>
	   <li>Any affiliate program, return, or financial adjustments a customer applies to a sale that were not a part of what LTD offered specifically to the fundraising program, including those offered on our non-fundraising site, will reduce the value of the rebate earned by the amount the customer received in their aforementioned discount.</li>
	   <li>LTD Commodities does not offer its full product array to our fundraising customers. We have restricted the customized fundraising site from gaining access to religious and spiritual items, toys that represent a gun or weapon of any kind, or products promoting alcohol or its consumption. However, once families shop with us they may opt in to obtain marketing material on their own, not affiliated or endorsed by the school fundraising program. Some of these marketing materials customers have opted into may demonstrate unrestricted products offered to our general site.</li>
	   <li>School families may continue to shop after the fundraising timeline ends from our full retail site that does not inhibit items that were removed as part of the fundraising program.</li>
	   <li>The timeframe for school fundraising during the 2017 year runs from 9.15.17 through 12.15.17. Sales made outside of this timeframe are not eligible for the rebate. Sales accrued prior to receiving a signed Master Agreement will not be eligible for a rebate.</li>
	   <li>Eligible orders less any returns, credits, ineligible promotions or affiliate discounts will be summed and a rebate check will be mailed only in the school name for deposit only to the school account on February 1st 2018. Checks cannot be made out to any individuals, but can be made to clubs or teams organized by the school.</li>
	   <li>A record of how the rebate check was calculated can be presented upon request and will be honored within 10 business days of receipt of request.</li>
	   <li>LTD Commodities reserves the right to inspect sales for authenticity and fraud and may cancel the program by school or in its entirety should fraud or other misrepresentations exist.</li>
	   <li>If members of school family find product offered in the fundraising program objectionable, they can contact LTD Commodities and request it be removed. We will act in the best interest of the full fundraising community. If the decision is to not remove the product the school administrator can decide to end the fundraising program for their school.</li>
	   <li>No minimum purchase is required by any school. If only 1 purchase is made, the school will be eligible for that rebate amount.</li>
	   <li>The rebate percentage is unique to each school based on size and goal attainment. This amount and the calculation are included in the copy of the Master Agreement.</li>

</article>
<div class="st_hd_ini st_hd faq-panel radius text-left faq_ansr">
  <p>No, they are not.  When your school registers for our fundraising program we provide you a unique URL just for your school. We have carefully selected products for school families which should <strong>NOT</strong> contain references to religious and spiritual themes, as well as those that appear related to alcohol consumption (wine or beer glasses, etc.). We have also eliminated any reference to any products related to hunting, or toy guns (including water pistols). If your school families are already shoppers with LTD Commodities, or elect to subscribe to our regular email and promotional offerings, unrestricted products not related to fundraising selections may appear in those advertisements, but will not appear nor can be purchased from the website we assign for your school's fundraising event.

<div class="st_hd_ini st_hd faq-panel radius text-left faq_ansr">
  <p>We customize programs for each school based on size and goals. Most schools will earn between 5-7% of all product sales. Shipping costs are not eligible for fundraising rebates. If customers place any returns, any items are cancelled, credits of any type are issued or if the customer places their order using an affiliate program, the amount the school is eligible to earn may be reduced by this offset. There are no minimum purchase requirements. Each eligible order earns credits for your school organization.</p>

<div class="st_hd_ini st_hd faq-panel radius text-left faq_ansr">
  <p>No!!! When customers place their order, they have their merchandise delivered to their home. This is one of the great benefits of LTD's Fundraising over other programs. The school only needs to make their unique URL available to their audience and help drive sales. There is no door to door selling, no funds to collect, no merchandise to distribute. Just advertise, and then wait for your fundraising check to arrive!!</p>

<div class="st_hd_ini st_hd faq-panel radius text-left faq_ansr"><p>

I placed an order using the installment plan payment option but I don't understand how it works?<i class="faq-panel--i fa fa-angle-down"></i></p>
</article>
<div class="st_hd_ini st_hd faq-panel radius text-left faq_ansr"><p>
The installment plan payment option allows eligible customers to pay for their purchase using 4 monthly installment payments.  It works like this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>
You place an order for merchandise over $100.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
When your in-stock merchandise ships and you are billed for 25% of the order, as well as 25% of any applicable shipping and taxes.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
30 days later the credit card you used at the time of the order will automatically bill for the next balance due of 25% of your shipment. This will happen again once a month until your bills is paid in full…usually a total of 90 days from the time the order shipped.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
If any items were on back order or shipped direct from one of our manufacturers, your order may split into additional installment payments. Each of these separate shipments will bill in its own 4 installment payment plan.
  </p></li>
  <li><p>
You will never be billed more than your original order total.
  </p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<article class="faq-panel radius text-center faq-quest"><p>

The Lakeside Collection reserves the right to offer different promotions and payment options at any time, and may remove this option on new or subsequent orders. Should you have further questions, please refer to our <a class="js-inter-card" href="#In81n_0">Terms and Conditions</a> or contact a credit representative at <span class="tel_link">847-444-3188</span>.

Please check your order status to determine if only a portion of your order shipped. If so, you will be billed in a separate installment payment plan for the remaining items, as they ship. This will mean you will have several smaller payments due to us all 30 days from each shipment date. However, the total amount paid will never exceed your original order value.

Be informed about fraudulent internet and phone practices:
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
<strong>Phishing</strong> is a technique of fraudulently obtaining private information. Typically, the phisher sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate business requesting verification of information and warning of some consequence if it is not provided. The email usually contains a link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate or has a form requesting everything from a home address to an ATM card's PIN.
		</p></li>
		<li><p>
<strong>Pretexting</strong> is a practice in which someone assumes the guise of another person in order to establish trust and extract private information, typically over the phone or through online communication. The scammer not only pretends to be someone they're not, but also creates a credible "pretext" for why such information is needed.
